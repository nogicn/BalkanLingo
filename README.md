# BalkanLingo

This is a language learning application based on the spaced repetition technique. It facilitates learning new words through a series of spaced questions from a predefined word database. Students answer by selecting the correct translation from multiple alternatives. Correct answers advance the word to the next review container in the sequence, while incorrect answers send it back to the first container. Each container has a specific time duration after which the word is ready to be presented again as a question. The first container's expiration time is one day, the second container's two days, the third container's four or more days, and so on. Typically, there are five or six containers in the sequence, with the last one having an expiration time of several weeks to a month. Words that are answered correctly after the last container's expiration are considered learned and no longer participate in the review process.
